## What is Bloop?

Bloop is not just another code editor—it's a complete reimagining of how developers interact with AI to build software. Every pixel, every interaction, and every feature has been designed from the ground up to create the most intuitive, powerful, and secure coding experience ever made.

This is the interface that developers deserve. This is Bloop.

## Why Bloop?

The tools developers use should be as innovative as the software they build. Current IDEs are bloated, slow, and weren't designed for the AI era.

**Bloop is different.**

We started from scratch, asking one question: *What would the perfect AI-powered development environment look like?*

The answer is an interface that:
- **Gets out of your way** — Clean, minimal, focused
- **Understands context** — AI that knows your codebase
- **Feels instant** — No lag, no loading, no waiting
- **Stays secure** — Built with security at its core

---

## Security

Security isn't an afterthought—it's foundational to everything we build.

### Content Security
- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) enforcement
- XSS protection with sanitized rendering
- No unsafe inline scripts or styles

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized before processing
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection

### Data Protection
- No telemetry without explicit consent
- Local-first architecture—your code stays yours
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configurations

### Secure Development
- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types in production
- Dependency auditing with automated vulnerability scanning
- Regular security reviews and updates

## The Vision

Bloop is here to change the game.

We're not building an incremental improvement. We're building the development environment that will define the next decade of software engineering.

The future of coding is:
- **Intelligent** — AI that understands, not just autocompletes
- **Fast** — Milliseconds matter
- **Secure** — Trust is earned, not assumed
- **Beautiful** — Because craft matters

**This is just the beginning.**
