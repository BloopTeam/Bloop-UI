## 🚀 What is Bloop?

Bloop is not just another code editor—it's a complete reimagining of how developers interact with AI to build software. We've designed every pixel, every interaction, and every feature from the ground up to create the most intuitive, powerful, and beautiful coding experience ever made.

This is the interface that developers deserve. This is Bloop.

## 💡 Why Bloop?

We believe the tools developers use should be as innovative as the software they build. Current IDEs are bloated, slow, and weren't designed for the AI era.

**Bloop is different.**

We started from scratch, asking one question: *What would the perfect AI-powered development environment look like?*

The answer is an interface that:
- **Gets out of your way** — Clean, minimal, focused
- **Understands context** — AI that knows your codebase
- **Feels instant** — No lag, no loading, no waiting
- **Looks incredible** — Because you spend 8+ hours a day here
